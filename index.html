        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>This survey presents a comprehensive review of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Systematic
            Literature Reviews (SLRs). A SLRs is a rigorous and organised methodology
            that assesses and integrates previous research on a given topic. Numerous tools have been developed to
            assist and partially automate the SLR process. The increasing role of AI in this field shows great potential
            in providing more effective support for researchers, moving towards the semi-automatic creation of
            literature reviews.
            Our study focuses on how AI techniques are applied in the semi-automation of SLRs, specifically in the
            screening and extraction phases. We examine 21 leading SLR tools using a framework that combines 24
            traditional features with 11 AI features. We also analyse 11 recent tools that utilize large language models
            for searching the literature and assisting academic writing.
            The paper discusses current trends in the field, outlines key research challenges, and suggests directions
            for future research.</p>
